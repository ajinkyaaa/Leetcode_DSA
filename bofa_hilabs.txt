Good afternoon,

Thank you for updating me with all the information yesterday regarding my onboarding delay.
I'm glad that the process is moving forward now; however, i am still worried that with all the 
delays and the long-weekend coming up, we will not be able to get me started before July 4th.

Joining Genesis for this BOFA opportunity is my first choice and I am willing to pay for the premium processing so that we can get the ball rolling.

While that is processing, I have got another offer from hilabs and they are ready to have me start on 23rd. But it is in maryland. 

I think the best option for me is that I start the other job to safegaurd my h1b status,
and then when the BOFA process / h1b transfer is fully complate, I can move back to jersey and join BOFA.

Being in jersey is a big prority for me so you can be rest assured that I will certaonly move back as soon as the h1b transfer is complete to BOFA.

What are your views? Is this doable? or can i start with BOFA ASAP (by June 25th latest)

Let me know your thoughts. 

Regards,
aee Pradip
