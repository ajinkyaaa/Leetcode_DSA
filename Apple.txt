Why apple?
There are two main reasons that I want to work for Apple. First of all, Apple is known to have an extremely supportive work environment that genuinely cares about its employee’s career growth. 
I want to be part of a team that will help me pursue my career development for years to come, and Apple seems like the perfect place for that.
Also, Apple provides its employees with a work-life balance that I believe would foster my best professional output. All in all, it seems that working for Apple would help me be the best employee I can.

Apple Product?
Iphone , The experience. It’s simple yet powerful. There is something about its experience that Android still couldn’t get.

Plus, the amount of great third-party apps that are better in an iPhone than in an Android.
Mainly because I know it'll still be getting security updates 5 years+ after I buy it. Phones are crazy expensive now, but if I can get 5 or 6 years of use out of one, I can justify the cost.
Hardware and software love. Both compliment each other swimmingly.
