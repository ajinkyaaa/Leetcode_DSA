Classes:- collection of objects, blueprints to create objects, has attributes and methods

Objects:- Entity that has state and behavior assosiated with it, it can be mouse keyboard, string, int

Inheritance:- is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
        Single Inheritance:
        Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.

        Multilevel Inheritance:
        Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class.

        Hierarchical Inheritance:
        Hierarchical level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.

        Multiple Inheritance:
        Multiple level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism simply means having many forms.

Encapsulation (private __) (Nothing is truely private)
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly 



===============================================================
classes:- 
    Variables:- class v
                instance v (self.... )

    methods:- 
        instance (self)
        class (use cls) and (@classmethod)
        static methid (use nothing) (@staticmethod)
    
    can create class inside class

Inheritance:-

Overloading and overriding:- 
    duck typing:- not concerend which class object, we can directly pass
