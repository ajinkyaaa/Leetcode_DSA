node -> virtual machine

pod ->=================================
 abstraction over container ->docker
 cretes layer on top of container
 usually 1 app per pod
 each pod gets ip address -> can communicaste with ip address
                                pod1
                        pod2            pod3 (service) =>ip address
 if pod dies, new replaces it. -> service attaches to pod, independant if pod alive or dead -> service have permanent ip address
replicas => deploymnt of blueprint pods
Database => stateful sets => they write to a database and synchronized and replicating pods
always deploy database ouytsdide of pods
